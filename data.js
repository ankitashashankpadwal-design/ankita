  But <strong>Rajasthan</strong> is a huge state, and there’s still so much more to explore.
</p>

<p>
  From the <strong>golden sands of the Thar Desert</strong> to the <strong>majestic forts and palaces</strong> that tell tales of valor and romance, 
  Rajasthan is a land of <span style="color: #d97706; font-weight: bold;">vibrant culture</span>, 
  <span style="color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">colorful festivals</span>, 
  and <span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: bold;">warm hospitality</span>.
</p>

<p>
  The state's rich heritage is reflected in its traditional music, 
  dance forms like <em>Ghoomar</em>, exquisite handicrafts, and delectable cuisine.
</p>

<p>
  Whether it's the bustling markets of <strong>Jaipur</strong>, the serene lakes of <strong>Udaipur</strong>, 
  or the historic grandeur of <strong>Jodhpur</strong> and <strong>Jaisalmer</strong>, 
  Rajasthan offers an <em>unforgettable journey</em> into India’s royal past and cultural richness.
